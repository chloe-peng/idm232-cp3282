There are numerous ways to test the doneness of your noodles when\nthey’re cooking. Some folk wisdom says to throw a piece of pasta against the\nwall; if it sticks, it\'s done. As much fun as we had experimenting with this\nmethod, we found the best way to test the pasta was, shockingly, by tasting it.\nIn Italian, \"al dente\" means \"to the tooth,\" meaning that it\'s still slightly firm\nto the bite. As your pasta cooks, periodically (and carefully) taste a piece of it.\nIf it\'s still too firm, let it cook a little longer.\nIn some of our recipes, we specify to remove the pasta from the pot when it\'s\n\"just shy of al dente.\" This is because, later, the pasta will be cooked in a\nsauce. Removing the pasta from the water just before it\'s al dente will ensure\nthat the final product isn\'t overcooked.', 'Shrimp_Fra_Diavolo', 'Lumaca_Rigata_Pasta'),
